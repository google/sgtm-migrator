# sGTM Migrator
**TL;DR** sGTM Migrator helps you speed up the setup of your server container tags by setting up the communication with the server container and by migrating all supported Google tags (Google Analytics 4, Google Ads, Floodlights, Conversion Linker) from your web container.

## Challenge
Setting up a server-side tagging using Google Tag Manager can be time consuming and very manual. Users simply cannot export a web container and import it into the server container. Instead users need to start modifying both the web container, to establish a communication with the server container using the Google Analytics 4 tag as a source tag, as well as the server container to replicate desired configuration of Google tags in their server environment.
Depending on a user's web container configuration, it can be a very complex manual and error prone task to replicate or modify multiple tags across both container types.

## Idea
The main purpose of the tool is to simplify and automate the process of setting up tags in a web container that point at and communicate with the server container as well as creating server tags for Google Analytics 4, Google Ads (Conversion Tracking, Remarketing), Floodlights and Conversion Linker that are based on existing tags in the web container. 

## Solution Description
sGTM Migrator will look up both workspaces from your Google Tag Manager web and server container and analyze which Google tags can be migrated to the server container. By default the tool will do the following steps with one click:

- Create a new web variable with a Google Analytics 4 Measurement ID (web data stream; G-xxxxxxxx) used for data collection through serverside Google Tag Manager
- Automatically duplicate all existing Google Analytics web tags and point them at the server container (root tags),
- Create a Google Analytics 4 server tag that will forward any incoming Google Analytics 4 request,
- Migrate all Google Ads Conversion Tracking, Google Ads Remarketing, Floodlights and Conversion Linker web tags to the server container,
- Auto-create all built-in server variables and user-defined server variables based on the incoming Google Analytics 4 requests (root tags). 

For more granular use cases, users are able to switch to an advanced configuration where a tag by tag level selection can be selected for a migration.

Please note, that triggers and some user-defined variables cannot be created due to different data models used across web and server containers. You are still responsible for checking if your migrated tags are working properly before publishing them to production.

## How to access the tool
It is strongly recommended that you use the template spreadsheet to use the sGTM Migrator script. Follow these steps to make a copy of the template spreadsheet and start using the tool:
1. Join the [sGTM Migrator Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/sgtm-migrator).
2. Make a copy of [SGTM Migrator (v1.20) spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JkP57DIHpDc6W-N-l7QGcxUf3k81p7FkWsMPgf_NwRs/edit?resourcekey=0-h-cb3OG-EWrYeeblr0bfjA#gid=1562666064).

When you first run the sGTM Migrator tool, Google Sheets will require you to authorize the usage of Apps Scripts within the sheet.

## Scope of the tool
The sGTM Migrator will require you to provide the following details:
- **URL to web container workspace** that you want to leverage
- **URL to server container workspace** that you want to update
- The **URL of your server container endpoint**, i.e. a subdomain 
- A **GA4 Measurement ID** for the data stream of a GA4 property(G-xxxxxxxx) that must be different from the ones currently used in the GA4 config tags in web container. Usually this will be a measurement ID from a property used to measure website behavior through the server setup.

Once these details have been provided, the tool offers two migration journeys:
1. A **one click migration**, that copies all existing GA4 tags in the web container and points them at a specified server container endpoint with a custom GA4 measurement ID (web data stream). All existing web tags for Google Ads Conversion Tracking, Google Ads Remarketing, Floodlights and Conversion Linker are replicated in the server container and a default Google Analytics 4 server tag is created that forwards all incoming Google Analytics 4 requests. 
2. For users seeking a custom migration of only certain but not all tags, the **advanced configuration** allows to select a subset of above-mentioned web tags which should be migrated. 

In both scenarios, built-in server variables are enabled in the server container. Additional user-defined server variables are created based on the incoming Google Analytics 4 web tags pointing at the server container (root tags). This includes common parameters such as URL Path or Hostname as well as any event parameter or user property found in the root tags.
